# Blu Assets Art

This is a guide to help you find library of acquired assets for projects. Each asset is in an individual branch for better organization.
In this document, there will be a link to each library, which will take you to the asset's git page.
Within each asset page, there is a Readme with the Asset store Link, and a series of images exemplifying the content.
